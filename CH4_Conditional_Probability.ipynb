To do so choose $k_1$ places in the $M$-tuple for the $1$s. There will be $M-k_1$ positions remaining. Of these positions choose $k_2$ places for the $2$s. Fill in the remaining $k_3=M-k_1-k_2$ positions using the $3$s. Using this result, determine the number of different $M$ digit sequences with $k_1$ $1$s, $k_2$ $2$s, and $k_3$ $3$s."
