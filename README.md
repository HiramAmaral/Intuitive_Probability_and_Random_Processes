# Overview:

This repo is a compliation of my personal notes and attempts at problem sets taken from [Steven Kay](https://web.uri.edu/engineering/meet/skay/)'s book [_Intuitive Probability and Random Processes using MATLAB_](https://www.ele.uri.edu/faculty/kay/New%20web/downloadable%20files/book_total.pdf). The errata of the book can be found [here](https://www.ele.uri.edu/faculty/kay/New%20web/corrections.pdf). I've taken the liberty of translating all the in-text code to Python and will write out simulations in Python as well. All typos and errors that may be found in these notebooks are my own.
